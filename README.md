# AI Passkeys Integration
_Time Estimate: 20 mins (Vibe Coding)_

Passkeys are supported on Soroban through the use of WebAuthn, a web standard for secure authentication. With passkeys, users can authenticate using a variety of methods, including biometrics (like fingerprint or facial recognition). This allows for a more secure and user-friendly authentication experience when interacting with Soroban dApps.

The Passkey Kit is used to create a contract account (wallet) that allows signing transactions with passkeys, and holding a token balance. The Passkey Kit is a TypeScript SDK that provides functionality for creating and managing passkey-based wallets on Soroban. It abstracts away the complexities of working with WebAuthn and Soroban smart contracts, making it easier for developers to integrate passkey authentication into their dApps.

## Why Use Passkeys?
* Users can register, authenticate and sign transactions, using biometrics or other secure methods
* Create a Web2-like user experience, without the need for using (or setting up) wallets
* Works across modern browsers and platforms

## Vibe Coding

Claude Code is capable of implementing passkey authentication flows using the Passkey Kit SDK, and create all the UI components and logic required for using the smart account as a wallet.

A prompt for implementing a passkey-based wallet might be as simple as this:

```
Create a web-based wallet with stellar soroban using passkeys for authorization
```

This will typically generate a Next.js app with all the necessary components and logic for creating a passkey-based wallet, registering passkeys, and sending and receiving XLM.

## Issues & Gotchas Discovered

### 1. WebAuthn rejects IP addresses as rpId

**Error:** `127.0.0.1 is an invalid domain`

**Cause:** The WebAuthn spec requires a valid domain name as the `rpId`. Browsers reject IP addresses (including `127.0.0.1`) outright before passkey-kit even gets the error.

**Fix:** Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`, not `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Also added a `getRpId()` helper in `wallet-context.tsx` that forces `rpId = "localhost"` when the browser is on `127.0.0.1`, as a belt-and-suspenders guard.

---

### 2. Generic "Wallet creation failed" with no detail

**Error:** `Wallet creation failed` (catch block falling through to generic message)

**Cause:** The thrown value was not an `Error` instance — passkey-kit was throwing a plain object. The original catch block only handled `err instanceof Error`.

**Fix:** Extended the error serialization in the catch block:
```typescript
const msg = err instanceof Error ? err.message
  : typeof err === "string" ? err
  : (JSON.stringify(err) ?? "Wallet creation failed");
```
Also added `console.error("createWallet error:", err)` for server-log visibility.

---

### 3. Wallet WASM hash was wrong (65 chars instead of 64)

**Error:** `{"code":404,"message":"Could not obtain contract wasm from server"}`

**Cause:** The `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_WASM_HASH` value in `.env.local` had 65 hex characters — one character too many. Stellar WASM hashes are exactly 32 bytes = 64 hex chars.

**Fix:** Fetched the canonical values from the passkey-kit GitHub repo. Correct values:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_WASM_HASH=ecd990f0b45ca6817149b6175f79b32efb442f35731985a084131e8265c4cd90
NEXT_PUBLIC_NATIVE_SAC_CONTRACT_ID=CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC
```

The SAC contract ID was also wrong (57 chars instead of 56 — Stellar contract IDs are 56 chars in Strkey encoding).

---

### 4. Fee-payer account not funded

**Error:** `FEE_PAYER_SECRET not configured in .env.local`

**Cause:** `.env.local` had a placeholder value. The passkey wallet architecture requires a server-side funded Stellar account to pay transaction fees for the smart wallet.

**Fix:** Generated a new keypair with `stellar-sdk`, funded via Friendbot (`https://friendbot.stellar.org/?addr=...`), and stored the secret in `.env.local`.

---

### 5. Etherfuse API returns plain text errors, not JSON

**Error:** `Unexpected token 'W', "Wallet add..." is not valid JSON`

**Cause:** Etherfuse returns plain text responses for certain error conditions (e.g. `"Wallet address is not valid..."`), but the original route handlers called `res.json()` unconditionally.

**Fix:** Replaced all Etherfuse API calls with a `parseResponse()` helper across all three routes:
```typescript
async function parseResponse(res: Response) {
  const text = await res.text();
  console.log(`[etherfuse] ${res.status} ${res.url}\n${text}`);
  try { return { ok: res.ok, status: res.status, data: JSON.parse(text), text }; }
  catch { return { ok: res.ok, status: res.status, data: null, text }; }
}
```

---

### 6. Etherfuse rejects Soroban C... contract addresses

**Error:** `Wallet address 'CDH3U5...' is not valid for blockchain 'stellar'`

**Cause:** Etherfuse's wallet API only accepts classic Stellar G... (Ed25519) addresses. Soroban contract addresses start with C... and use a different Strkey format — Etherfuse's validation rejects them.

**Fix:** Changed the Etherfuse integration to use the **fee-payer's public key** (G...) as the Etherfuse wallet identity instead of the smart contract address:
1. Derive `feePayerPublicKey` from `FEE_PAYER_SECRET` server-side
2. Call `ensureWalletRegistered()` before every quote (idempotent — 409 = already registered)
3. Return `feePayerPublicKey` in the quote response
4. `OnRamp` and `OffRamp` components pass `quote.feePayerPublicKey` to order creation

---

### 7. Classic vs Soroban transaction routing

**Gotcha:** Stellar has two parallel transaction systems that do not mix:

| Operation | Build with | Submit to |
|---|---|---|
| Soroban contract call (SAC transfer) | `StellarSdk` + Soroban RPC simulation | Soroban RPC (`sendTransaction`) |
| Classic payment / ChangeTrust | `TransactionBuilder` | Horizon (`/transactions`) |

Submitting a classic operation to Soroban RPC (or vice versa) silently fails or returns cryptic errors. The `ChangeTrust` (trustline) feature and the Freighter `Payment` must go to Horizon. The passkey SAC transfer goes to Soroban RPC.

---

### 8. `@stellar/stellar-sdk/minimal` exports

**Gotcha:** Server-side API routes use `@stellar/stellar-sdk/minimal` to avoid importing the full SDK (which pulls in browser globals). This subpath re-exports `@stellar/stellar-base`, so `Operation`, `Asset`, `Account`, `TransactionBuilder`, `Keypair`, and `BASE_FEE` are all available — but only those primitives. Higher-level Soroban helpers are not.

---

### 9. `@stellar/freighter-api` v6 API changed

**Gotcha:** The API changed significantly across major versions. In v6.x:
- `getPublicKey()` is gone → replaced by `getAddress()` returning `{ address: string; error? }`
- `signTransaction()` returns `{ signedTxXdr: string; signerAddress: string; error? }` (not `signedPayload`)
- All functions return result objects; errors come as `{ error: { code, message } }` rather than thrown exceptions

The code was written against the v6 source after reading `node_modules` directly to avoid guessing.

---

### 10. Freighter accounts use Horizon for balance, not Soroban

**Gotcha:** The passkey smart wallet holds XLM via the SAC (Stellar Asset Contract), so balance is queried via a Soroban read call (`native.balance({ id: contractId })`). A Freighter account is a classic Stellar account — its balance lives in Horizon's ledger state. Querying the SAC with a G... address would return 0 or an error.

**Fix:** `refreshBalance()` in `wallet-context.tsx` branches on `walletType`:
- `"passkey"` → SAC balance call
- `"freighter"` → `GET https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/accounts/{publicKey}` → parse `balances[].asset_type === "native"`

## Key Design Decisions

**Fee-payer pattern:** The smart wallet (C... address) has no classic Stellar account, so it cannot pay fees directly. A separate server-side G... keypair pays all network fees and signs the outer transaction envelope. The passkey only signs the inner Soroban auth entry.

**Two-layer signing (passkey wallet):**
1. `kit.sign(xdr)` — user's WebAuthn credential signs the Soroban authorization entry (proves intent)
2. Server-side keypair signs the outer envelope (pays fees and satisfies Stellar's signature requirement)

**Freighter sends as classic payments:** Freighter accounts are classic Stellar accounts. XLM transfers use `Operation.payment()` submitted to Horizon, not the SAC `transfer()` Soroban call.

**Etherfuse uses fee-payer identity:** Since Etherfuse requires a classic G... address and the passkey wallet is a C... contract, the server's fee-payer G... key acts as the Etherfuse wallet identity for both on-ramp and off-ramp.
